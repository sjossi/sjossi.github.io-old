I'm just starting this off, but I decided that I need to save all my little scripts
and tools and configs that are lounging around my $HOME and share them. Many
times there are solutions that were not readily available, so I'll try to
highlight those. Other times it's just a collection of snippets from other
places. I won't be able to trace everything back to where I found it, so the
originality of all the bits and pieces can be blurry. I will be mindful of
proprietary code though, and might have to leave out certain bits and pieces or
refer to other sources.
