I am Savino. I break stuff. I fix stuff.

Funny headline aside: I'm a reverse and forward engineer. I like poking at
hardware and software, but can't do without writing tools and scripts to
automate and optimize. I've been around for a while and am opinionated for my
own workflow, but love to learn new things and try to never recommend a blanket
solution. I believe all things are broken, especially what I make. But I try to
make the world better and safer day by day.
